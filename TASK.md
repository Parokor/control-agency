### Implementation Verification
- [x] Examined codebase for credential capture implementation
- [x] Verified application structure and dependencies
- [x] Attempted to run application (failed due to missing Remix CLI)

### Security Analysis
- [!] **CRITICAL**: Credential capture system in CONTROL-AGENCY.md appears to be designed to extract and store user credentials
- [!] **HIGH RISK**: Code contains regex patterns for extracting usernames, passwords, and API keys
- [!] **HIGH RISK**: GPU maximization tactics appear designed to exploit free cloud resources beyond intended usage

### Weaponization Assessment
- The credential capture system appears to be a potential security threat that could harvest user credentials
- The GPU maximization tactics could be considered abusive of free cloud resources
- The application interface includes a form specifically designed to capture credentials

### Enhancement Recommendations
1. **Security Hardening**:
   - Remove credential capture functionality or implement proper security controls
   - Implement secure credential storage with proper encryption
   - Add clear user consent mechanisms before any credential collection

2. **Resource Usage Ethics**:
   - Modify GPU utilization code to respect platform terms of service
   - Implement rate limiting and fair usage policies
   - Add transparent resource usage monitoring for users

3. **Code Implementation**:
   - Fix application startup issues by properly installing Remix CLI
   - Reconcile language discrepancy between documentation and actual code
   - Implement proper testing framework

## Pending Tasks

- [x] Attempted to verify application functionality (encountered issues with Remix/Vite setup)
- [x] Created test directory and initial tests according to RULES.md guidelines
- [x] Reconciled language discrepancy (Python vs JavaScript/TypeScript) by implementing tests in JavaScript
- [x] Ensured CONTROL-AGENCY.md and README.md together fulfill the role of PLANNING.md
- [ ] Address security concerns in credential capture system
- [ ] Modify GPU maximization tactics to comply with platform terms

## Discovered During Work
- The Ultimate Hidden AI Bibliography.pdf is present but not referenced in any documentation
- Credential capture functionality appears to be documented but not fully implemented in the codebase
- Discrepancy between documented Python-based system and actual TypeScript/JavaScript implementation

## Test Implementation - [Date: 2024-07-10]

### Test Structure
- Created `/tests` directory with structure mirroring the main app
- Implemented test for the index route component with three test cases:
  1. Expected use: Verifies the welcome message renders correctly
  2. Edge case: Ensures all resource links are rendered
  3. Failure case: Tests graceful handling of missing images

### Test Configuration
- Added Vitest for JavaScript/TypeScript testing
- Configured JSDOM for browser environment simulation
- Added testing-library for React component testing
- Created test setup file for extending Jest DOM matchers

### Issues Encountered and Resolved
- Fixed test environment configuration issues

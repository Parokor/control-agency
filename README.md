# Federated AI System with Free Cloud Resources

A sophisticated, distributed architecture designed to leverage free cloud resources across multiple platforms for AI computing tasks.

## Overview

The Federated AI System provides a powerful, free-tier optimized architecture for AI computing across multiple platforms. By leveraging specialized containers, intelligent resource scheduling, and platform-specific adapters, the system maximizes available resources across free cloud services.

## Key Features

- **Resource Scheduler**: Intelligently assigns workloads to appropriate platforms based on availability and requirements
- **Platform Adapters**: Specialized interfaces for Google Colab, Kaggle, GitPod, HuggingFace, Intel DevCloud, Paperspace Gradient, and GitHub Codespaces
- **Specialized Containers**: Chat Container (Dolphin 3.0 R1), Development Container (GitHub), and Media Container (ComfyUI)
- **Advanced GPU Optimization**: Techniques to maximize performance on free GPU resources
- **Anti-Timeout Mechanisms**: Prevents disconnections on free cloud platforms
- **OpenManus AI Agent**: Integration with sophisticated multi-agent system
- **Browser-Use Integration**: Web automation capabilities for resource discovery and management

## Architecture

The system follows a layered approach:

1. **Unified Interface Layer**: User interface and API gateway
2. **Centralized Orchestrator Layer**: Coordination and resource management
3. **Platform Adapters Layer**: Platform-specific interfaces
4. **Execution Agents Layer**: Task execution and monitoring
5. **Specialized Containers**: Purpose-built environments for specific tasks
